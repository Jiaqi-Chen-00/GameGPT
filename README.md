# GameGPT

**AcademicNexus** aims to build an intelligent academic search engine leveraging GPT-3.5-turbo. Our initial focus is on Arxiv, a popular repository for academic papers, due to its accessible API and easy-to-parse search results format.


## Features
* Keyword extraction: GPT-3.5-turbo processes the title and abstract of the user-provided paper and extracts relevant keywords.
* Arxiv search: The extracted keywords are used to search for related papers on Arxiv.
* Paper ranking: GPT-3.5-turbo ranks the search results based on their titles and relevance to the user's query.
* Summary generation: The top-ranked papers' abstracts are processed, and GPT-3.5-turbo generates a summary highlighting the relationships between the user's query paper and the related papers.
